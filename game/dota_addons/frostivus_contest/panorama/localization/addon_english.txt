Defeat those powerful bosses in order to gain the favor of each altar. \n\n- Defeating a boss awards presents, gold, experience, and control over its elemental altar. \n- Collecting presents grants gold and experience to your entire team. \nGood luck!"

Periodically, he will drop a huge amount of presents in the area. Be there to collect them!"
